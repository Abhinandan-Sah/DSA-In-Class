Problem Statement



You have been assigned the task of developing a student management system for a school. The system needs to maintain a sorted doubly linked list of student records based on their roll numbers in ascending order. Each student record consists of the student's roll number.



You are required to implement a function that allows the registration of new students into the system while ensuring that their records are inserted in the appropriate sorted position in the doubly linked list. The system should handle the addition of new student records efficiently and maintain the sorted order of the student list at all times.



Additionally, the system should provide a feature to display the student records in sorted order based on their roll numbers.



Note: This is a sample question asked in the Google recruitment.

Input format :
The input begins with an integer N, representing the number of student records to be registered.

This is followed by N lines, each containing an integer representing the roll number of a student.

Output format :
The output displays the student records in ascending order based on their roll numbers.

Each student record is displayed on a new line, containing the roll number of the student.

Code constraints :
The roll numbers of students are unique positive integers.

The maximum number of students in the system is limited to a specific value (e.g., 100).

The roll numbers of students are within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3
2 4 1
3
Output 1 :
Created Doubly Linked List:
1 2 3 4 
Input 2 :
1
5
2
Output 2 :
Created Doubly Linked List:
2 5
