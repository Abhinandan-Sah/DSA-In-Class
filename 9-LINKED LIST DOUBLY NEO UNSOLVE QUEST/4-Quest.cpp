Problem Statement



Your task is to create a program that manages a doubly linked list and performs the deletion of a node at a specified position. The program should allow the user to input the number of nodes, their values, and the position of the node to be deleted. After the deletion, the program should display the updated doubly linked list in reverse order.



Note: This is a sample question asked in a TCS interview.

Input format :
The input begins with an integer n, representing the number of nodes in the doubly linked list.

The next line contains n space-separated integers representing the data values of each node.

Finally, an integer p is provided, representing the position of the node to be deleted.

Output format :
The program should output the doubly linked list before and after the deletion of the specified node.

The linked list should be displayed in reverse order as a space-separated list of integers.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The position of the node to be deleted should be a valid position within the range of the linked list.

The doubly linked list can contain positive integers.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
4
10 20 30 40
3
Output 1 :
Doubly linked list before deletion:
40 30 20 10 
Doubly linked list after deletion:
40 30 10 
Input 2 :
5
5 2 4 8 10
7
Output 2 :
Doubly linked list before deletion:
10 8 4 2 5 
Doubly linked list after deletion:
10 8 4 2 5
