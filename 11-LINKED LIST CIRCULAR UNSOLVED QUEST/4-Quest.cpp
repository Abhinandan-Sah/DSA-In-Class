Problem Statement

You are assigned the task of implementing a program that operates on a circular header linked list, a unique type of linked list in which the last node points back to the header node, forming a circular structure. 

Your objective is to create a program that inserts elements at the end of the circular linked list and displays its contents.

Note: This is a sample question asked in TCS recruitment.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the size of the list.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers, representing the elements to be inserted at the end of the list.

Output format :
The output prints the elements of the circular header linked list, separated by space.

If no elements are inserted, print "Linked List is empty".

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output 1 :
1 2 3 4 5 
Input 2 :
0
Output 2 :
Linked List is empty.
