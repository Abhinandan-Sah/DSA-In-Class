Problem Statement



In the land of LinkedListia, there was a circular header linked list kingdom ruled by King LinkedList. The linked list was unique, with its last node pointing back to the header node. 



A wise advisor named Swapia arrived in the kingdom with a special task. They had a circular header linked list filled with elements. The advisor's mission was to perform pairwise swapping of adjacent elements in the list. 



Design a circular header linked list and perform a pairwise swap operation to swap adjacent elements.



Note: This is a sample question asked in Accenture recruitment.

Input format :
The first line represents the number of elements in the linked list n.

The next line represents the n elements in the linked list.

Output format :
The first line of output represents the original linked list.

The second line of output represents the pairwise swap in the linked list.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output 1 :
Original linked list: 1 2 3 4 5 
Linked list after pairwise swapping: 2 1 4 3 5 
Input 2 :
2
7 8
Output 2 :
Original linked list: 7 8 
Linked list after pairwise swapping: 8 7
