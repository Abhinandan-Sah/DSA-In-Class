Problem Statement



You are given the task of developing a program that operates on a circular header linked list, a variant of the standard linked list. In this circular header linked list, the last node points back to the header node, forming a circular structure. 



Your goal is to implement a program that inserts elements at the end of the circular linked list and prints the data values of alternate nodes.



Note: This is a sample question asked in TCS recruitment.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the size of the list.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers, representing the elements to be inserted at the end of the list.

Output format :
The output prints the alternate nodes of the circular header linked list.

If no elements are inserted, print "Linked List is empty".



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
n should be odd

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output 1 :
Alternate Nodes: 1 3 5 
Input 2 :
0
Output 2 :
Linked List is empty.
