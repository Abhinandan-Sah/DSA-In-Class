Problem Statement



You are developing a program for a company to manage employee records. As part of the record management functionality, you need to implement a function that splits a grounded header-linked list of employee records into two separate lists: one for employees with even employee IDs and another for employees with odd employee IDs.



Implement a function to split a grounded header linked list into two separate lists, dividing the elements based on their parity (even and odd).



Note: This is a sample question asked in Infosys recruitment.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of the number of elements n in the list.

The second line of input consists of n elements, separated by space.

Output format :
The first line of output prints the list of even elements.

The second line of output prints the list of odd elements.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output 1 :
Even List: 2 4 
Odd List: 1 3 5 
Input 2 :
8
1 2 4 6 8 10 12 14
Output 2 :
Even List: 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 
Odd List: 1
